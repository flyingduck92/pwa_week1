            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>6 sausages</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use good quality ones where possible</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>60ml milk</li>
                <li>45ml plain flour</li>
                <li>100g fresh white breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>vegetable oil to cook</li>
                <li>60ml low fat mayonnaise</li>
                <li>30ml wholegrain mustard</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place 3 eggs in a small pan, cover with boiling water and bring to the boil. Cook for 6 mins. Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise and mustard together and spoon into a small dish.</li>
                <li>Drain the eggs, rinse in cold water tapping the shells all over. When cool enough to handle peel away the shells. Heat the oil in a fryer or deep large pan to 160C/325F.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, use a knife to cut the sausage skins and peel them away. Mix the sausagemeat together and divide into Beat the remaining egg with the milk and place in a shallow dish. Place the flour and breadcrumbs on plates.</li>
                <li>Flatten the sausagemeat, roll the boiled egg in flour then wrap the sausagemeat around the egg to make a neat egg shape. Roll the egg in the flour; dip in the beaten egg. then roll in the bread crumbs. Repeat dipping the egg in flour, egg and breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>Use a slotted spoon to carefully lower the eggs into the hot fat and cook for 8 mins or until the eggs are golden on the outside (it's important that the oil is not too hot., so that the sausagemeat has a chance to cook though).</li>
                <li>Remove the egg from the hot fat and drain on kitchen paper. leave to cool. Serve warm or cold with salad and the mustard mayo.</li>
            </ol>
